# My Chat App

The site was deployed with help of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform) (for server-side part) and [Netlify] (https://www.netlify.com/) (front-end part).\
Main libraries used in the project are:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Technologies such as Material UI, SCSS, react-loader-spinner, react-spring, react-transition-group, react-emojify and Local Storage were also applied.

## Project goal
The goal was to create a functional app, which would utilize Socket interface in conjunction with database and frontend.\
I thought myself that it would be convenient to use MongoDB, as it's quite easy to adapt it together with JS. I also prefer using NoSQL over SQL databases, so in the end that could have been the main reason to choose Mongo.\
In my opinion, the decision of applying React was also not a bad idea, as the interaction with it's API is pretty enjoyable.\
Apart from that, there is a bunch of other technologies such as react-spring for an instance, that take an advantage of the functionalities delivered by React, making the library a really good choice, as far as SPA's are concerned.
