The site was deployed with help of Heroku (for server-side part) and Netlify (front-end part).\
I've used plain React for JS part and SCSS mixed with Material UI for styling the components.\
Backend was made with Socket.io to handle dynamic message sending and MongoDB for storing info on logged user (name and room).\
In order to handle some more unusual validation cases localStorage was used.\

NOTE: as of 24.05.2020 there may be still some problems with styles on Internet Explorer, as some of the CSS properties are not supported by IE :c I'll take care of it in some free time.
